            <p>&nbsp;Pebble is a tiny ball of fluff with a 
                big personality! This spoiled, 
                attention-loving explorer spends 
                half the time on the wheel and the 
                other half doing tricks for snacks. 
                Cute, crafty, and always the center 
                of attention—Pebble knows how to 
                work the crowd! 🐹✨</p> <!-- Descriptive paragraph about the hamster -->

            <p>&nbsp;Goofy is a chill observer with a 
                flair for drama! She loves climbing 
                her platform, making a splashy 
                dive, and pretending she didn’t 
                notice you watching. But dare to 
                touch her? She’s off faster than 
                you’d think a turtle could move! 🐢💦</p> <!-- Descriptive paragraph about the turtle -->
